[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1--alpha-blue.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/farpyscript)

FarpyScript is an experimental interpreted programming language focused on security, developed as an open-source educational project.

## Current Version

- **Version**: 0.0.1  
- **Status**: Early development  
- **Last update**: January 2025  

## Overview

FarpyScript was born out of curiosity about the inner workings of programming languages. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in interpreter development, being built completely from scratch.

Partially inspired by the [guide-to-interpreters-series](https://github.com/tlaceby/guide-to-interpreters-series) project, FarpyScript implements a recursive descent parser, ideal for educational purposes and small-scale projects.

## Instalation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FernandoTheDev/farpyscript
cd farpyscript
```

Repl:
```bash
deno run -A main.ts
```

File:
```bash
deno run -A main.ts <FILE>.fscript
```

In the future, binary with path will come

## Development Status

### Implemented ‚úÖ

- Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)  
- Verbose error handling system  
- Parser (Syntax Analyzer) 
- Type System  
  - Mutable and immutable variables  
  - Strong typing  
  - Variable redeclaration  
 - Built-in constants  

### In Progress üöß

 
- Type System  
  - Complex types (objects, arrays, vectors)  
- Language Features  
  - Function declaration and calls  
  - Recursion  
  - Control flow structures (if, for, while, try/catch)  
- Native Libraries  
  - I/O  
  - Math  
  - HTTP  
  - Built-in constants  

## Architecture

The interpreter follows a recursive descent parser architecture, chosen for its:  
- Simplicity of implementation  
- Ease of understanding  
- Suitability for educational purposes
